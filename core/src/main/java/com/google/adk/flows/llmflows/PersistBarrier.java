/**
 * Lets {@link BaseLlmFlow}'s multi-step loop wait until the {@code Runner} -- the sole event
 * persister -- has appended the current step's events, so the next step's request (built from
 * {@code session.events()} by {@link Contents}) is not assembled from a stale session. The {@code
 * Runner} calls {@link #markPersisted} (or {@link #markFailed}) after each append; the flow calls
 * {@link #awaitPersisted} between steps. State lives in the per-invocation {@link
 * InvocationContext#callbackContextData()} map, shared across the agent tree.
 *
 * <p>Each event id maps to a {@link CompletableSubject}: pending until its append finishes, then
 * terminally completed or failed. The subject retains its terminal state, so {@code
 * awaitPersisted}/{@code mark*} may happen in any order and a late await -- e.g. at a higher flow
 * level across an agent transfer -- resolves immediately. If an append fails, the matching await
 * fails with that error rather than blocking forever.
 *
 * <p>Thread-safe and lock-free: {@code markPersisted}/{@code markFailed} may run off-thread (async
 * {@code appendEvent}) concurrently with {@code awaitPersisted}; {@link
 * java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentHashMap#computeIfAbsent} hands both sides the same subject, which
 * itself serializes its terminal signal against subscription.
